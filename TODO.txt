TODO

Make it so that users can only edit, update, and destroy places that belong to them.

Figure out a way to assign more users to a place. Maybe ask the creating user for permission.

Make a Library System model that includes other info

Style the application.html.erb so that Log-In & Sign out are in a column and only appear if applicable.

Style Places index so it's more of a collection instead of a table, eg. little rectangles instead of rows. Maybe filter by category or something.
